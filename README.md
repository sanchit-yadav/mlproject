## End to end machine learning project

### Project Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates a student's academic performance based on key personal and behavioral featuresâ€”specifically gender, age, and study hours. By analyzing these inputs, the model can forecast expected scores, helping educators and learners identify patterns that influence academic success.
